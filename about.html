									<p>I am a seasoned data analyst and proficient technical project manager with a robust background in healthcare. Armed with expertise in <strong>T-SQL</strong>, <strong>Python</strong>, and <strong>Excel</strong>, I specialize in spearheading project deliverables, and crafting insightful reports using <strong>Power BI</strong> and Crystal Reports.</p>
									<p>Regular reviews of projects in <strong>Azure DevOps</strong>, coupled with sprint meetings prioritizing product backlogs, form the cornerstone of my project management approach.
										My daily interactions are client-facing, engaging with stakeholders to deliver transparent updates on project status through the lens of <strong>Scrum</strong> methodology, supported by my <strong>CSM</strong> certification from Scrum Alliance. My role extends across the team, collaborating closely with engineers to translate customer requests into detailed scope documentation while conveying technical information to non-technical audiences.</p>
									<p>The opportunities I have been presented have allowed me to interact with different aspects of organizations. I play a pivotal role in responding to <strong>Request for Proposals (RFPs)</strong> and managing the entire <strong>Source to Pay (S2P)</strong> lifecycle, all in adherence to <strong>SOC 2</strong> compliance and <strong>HIPAA</strong> standards. 
										I am the go-to individual when it comes to conducting internal onboarding, as well as client trainings. With an experience in <strong>public speaking</strong> and presenting to stakeholders, I have also attended various trade shows and conferences as a technical specialist conducting product demos.</p>	
									<p>During audits, I contribute significantly by furnishing SQL-based reports to auditors at both state and federal levels, consistently maintaining satisfactory compliance ratings.
										When dealing with the inventory and distribution of controlled substances, <u>every milligram is to be accounted for and tracked as it moves from clinics to patients</u>. The thoroughness that the <strong>DEA</strong> demands in their reports has cultivated a baseline of nothing less than excellence and accuracy in my work. </p>
									<p>My proficiency extends to categorizing information using <strong>data domains</strong> and mapping them into HL7 integrations. The commitment to <strong>data-driven decision-making</strong> is evident in the creation of comprehensive dashboards and reports. Prior to creating any visualizations, I develop and share best practices for code quality, versioning, repository, <strong>documentation</strong>, and data flows.
										Utilizing <strong>ETL</strong> processes, I ensure the seamless flow of data during large-scale transitions to <strong>cloud-based SaaS</strong> solutions. 
										Additionally, I have hands-on experience configuring <strong>digital payments</strong> to facilitate "card not present" transactions, enabling seamless online transactions directly from webpages.</p>
									<br>
									<p><strong>In essence, I am a versatile professional who thrives at the crossroads of technology, healthcare, and project management, ensuring the seamless integration of data, compliance, and innovation.</strong></p>
